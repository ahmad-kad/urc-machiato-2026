## üöÄ **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Start with Docker**: Develop all algorithm components in containers
2. **Identify Hardware Needs**: Determine which components need native access
3. **Implement Hybrid Architecture**: Use ROS 2 bridges between containerized and native components
4. **Gradual Migration**: Move hardware-dependent components to native as needed
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Keep development workflows similar across environments

The Docker environment provides an excellent foundation for 75% of autonomy development while maintaining flexibility for hardware-intensive components.
