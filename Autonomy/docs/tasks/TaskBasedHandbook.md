# Abstract Task Workflow: Autonomy Development Strategy

## Welcome to the Autonomy Team! ü§ñ

This handbook provides **high-level task workflows** with abstract understanding rather than granular implementation details. Focus on **conceptual flow** and **system-level thinking** - technical details are in the subsystem TODO.md files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Competition Compliance Requirements**

All development must meet **URC 2026 Competition Rules**:

### **Mission 1.e: Equipment Servicing**
- **Autonomous Typing**: 3-6 letter launch codes with backspace/delete correction
- **ArUco Markers**: 2x2cm at keyboard corners, 1x1cm at USB slot corners
- **Operator Limits**: Intervention only for mode exit/abort/restart

### **Mission 1.f: Autonomous Navigation**
- **LED Status**: üî¥ Red (autonomous), üîµ Blue (teleoperation), üü¢ Flashing Green (success)
- **7 Targets**: 2 GNSS (3m), 2 posts with 3-sided visual markers (20√ó20cm faces, 2.5cm cells, 2m), 3 objects (10m) - flexible order
- **C2 Display**: Highlight detected objects (one at a time)
- **Abort Penalty**: 20% reduction for teleoperation return

## üéØ Task Strategy Overview

| **Task Phase** | **Focus** | **Key Outcome** | **Time** | **Dependencies** |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | Environment & Infrastructure | Working dev environment | 1-2 days | None |
| **Core Algorithms** | SLAM, Navigation, Vision | Functional autonomy subsystems | 1-2 weeks | Foundation |
| **Integration** | System communication, testing | Coordinated multi-subsystem operation | 1 week | Core Algorithms |
| **Optimization** | Performance, reliability | Competition-ready system | 1-2 weeks | Integration |

## üîÑ High-Level Development Flow

### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-2)**
**Goal:** Establish development infrastructure and basic understanding

    A[Join Team] --> B[Read TeamIntegration.md]
    B --> C[Setup Development Environment]
    C --> D[Understand System Architecture]
    D --> E[Pick First Subsystem]
    E --> F[Begin Core Algorithm Development]
```

**Key Activities:**
- Docker environment setup
- ROS2 workspace configuration
- Basic node communication testing
- Subsystem selection based on interests

---

### **Phase 2: Core Algorithm Development (Weeks 1-2)**
**Goal:** Build functional autonomy capabilities

```mermaid

    A[Choose Subsystem] --> B[Read subsystem/ Guide]
    B --> C[Study TODO.md Structure]
    C --> D[Implement Core Algorithm]
    D --> E[ROS2 Interface Integration]
    E --> F[Basic Testing & Validation]
    F --> G[Subsystem Ready for Integration]
```

**Subsystem Parallel Development:**
- **Navigation**: Path planning + GPS fusion
- **SLAM**: Pose estimation + mapping
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection + tracking
- **Autonomous Typing**: Keyboard detection + manipulation
- **State Management**: Mission coordination + health monitoring
- **LED Status**: Visual signaling + GPIO control

---

### **Phase 3: System Integration (Week 3)**
**Goal:** Connect subsystems into working system

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Individual Subsystems Ready] --> B[ROS2 Topic/Service Setup]
    B --> C[Interface Contract Compliance]
    C --> D[Multi-subsystem Testing]
    D --> E[Integration Issues Resolution]
    E --> F[System-level Mission Execution]
```

**Integration Activities:**
- Cross-subsystem communication verification
- Mission scenario testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Failure mode handling

---

### **Phase 4: Optimization & Competition Prep (Weeks 4-5)**
**Goal:** Competition-ready performance and reliability

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Functional System] --> B[Performance Profiling]
    B --> C[Bottleneck Optimization]
    C --> D[Environmental Testing]
    D --> E[Competition Scenario Validation]
    E --> F[Documentation & Deployment]
```

**Final Activities:**
- Real-world testing conditions
- System reliability validation
- Competition procedure documentation
- Backup system preparation

## üìö Recommended Reading Order

### **Phase 1: Getting Started (Day 1)**
1. **[QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md)** - 5-minute environment setup
2. **[TeamIntegration.md](../onboard/TeamIntegration.md)** - Team boundaries and responsibilities

## üéØ Key Principles for Task-Based Development

### **Abstract Thinking First**
- **Understand the "why"** before the "how"
- **Focus on system-level interactions** rather than implementation details
- **Plan for integration** from day one

### **Parallel Development Strategy**
- **6 subsystems develop simultaneously** (not sequentially)
- **ROS2 interfaces** ensure clean integration
- **Regular sync points** prevent divergence

### **Quality over Speed**
- **Test early, test often** - integration issues are expensive to fix
- **Document as you go** - future you will thank present you
- **Review before merge** - catch issues before they propagate

## üöÄ Success Patterns

**What successful team members do:**
- **Read the big picture docs first** (this handbook, TeamIntegration, SystemArchitecture)
- **Choose one subsystem** and become an expert in it
- **Communicate regularly** with other team members
- **Test integration points** early and often
- **Document lessons learned** for the team

**What to avoid:**
- **Working in isolation** - autonomy systems require coordination
- **Ignoring interfaces** - ROS2 communication is critical
- **Late integration** - test with other subsystems weekly
- **Technical debt** - clean code from day one

**Remember: You're building a system that will autonomously navigate a desert rover. Think big, start small, integrate often!** üèúÔ∏èü§ñ
