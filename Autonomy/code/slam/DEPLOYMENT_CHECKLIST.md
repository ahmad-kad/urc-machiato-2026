colcon build --packages-select autonomy_slam
source install/setup.bash

# 2. Install system dependencies
sudo apt install ros-humble-rtabmap-ros ros-humble-rtabmap
pip install numpy opencv-python scipy

# 3. Verify installation
ros2 pkg list | grep autonomy_slam
python3 -c "import cv2, numpy; print('Dependencies OK')"

# 4. Test basic launch
ros2 launch autonomy_slam slam_rtabmap.launch.py &
sleep 10
ros2 node list  # Should show: depth_processor, rtabmap, gps_fusion_node, slam_orchestrator
killall ros2
```

## Pre-Mission Checklist

### Hardware Verification
- [ ] RGB-D camera connected and visible: `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`
- [ ] GPS receiver connected: `ls -la /dev/ttyUSB*`
- [ ] Camera publishing frames: `ros2 topic hz /camera/rgb/image_raw`
- [ ] GPS publishing fixes: `ros2 topic echo /gps/fix` (shows fixes)

### Calibration
- [ ] Camera intrinsics available: `ls ~/.ros/*camera*.yaml`
- [ ] Hand-eye calibration available (if using): `ls ~/.ros/*hand_eye*.yaml`
- [ ] Calibration < 1 week old (check file timestamp)
- [ ] Backup calibration stored: `cp ~/.ros/camera_*.yaml ./backup_calibration/`

### Parameter Tuning
- [ ] Environment type assessed (very dusty / normal / clear)
- [ ] rtabmap_desert.yaml parameters adjusted for site
- [ ] Memory limit set for Pi: `Mem/MaxMemoryMB: 500`
- [ ] Feature extraction tuned: `Kp/MaxFeatures: 400` or adjusted

### System Configuration
- [ ] ROS 2 environment sourced: `source install/setup.bash`
- [ ] No conflicting processes: `ros2 node list` (clean)
- [ ] Network connectivity verified if using remote monitoring
- [ ] Time synchronized: `timedatectl` (check time accuracy)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Mission System Check
```bash
# Terminal 1: Launch full SLAM system
ros2 launch autonomy_slam slam_rtabmap.launch.py

# Terminal 2: Monitor health
ros2 topic echo /slam/system/health

# Terminal 3: Verify topics
ros2 topic list | grep slam
```

### 2. Wait for Initialization
- Watch for "READY" in `/slam/system/health`
- Typical initialization time: 5-30 seconds
- Look for features count increasing
- Confidence level should stabilize > 0.5

### 3. Verify GPS Lock
```bash
ros2 topic echo /gps/fix
# Watch for status field (0 = no fix, >0 = has fix)
```

### 4. Check Fusion Mode
```bash
ros2 topic echo /slam/fusion/status
# Should show: "Mode: gps_slam_fusion" once running
```

## Monitoring During Mission

### Real-Time Checks
```bash
# Check pose updates (should see new msgs)
ros2 topic hz /slam/pose/fused

# Monitor memory usage
watch -n 1 "ps aux | grep rtabmap"

# Monitor CPU usage
top -b -n 1 | grep rtabmap

# Check for errors
ros2 node info /depth_processor
ros2 node info /slam_orchestrator
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Feature count: Should be > 50
- SLAM confidence: Should be > 0.5
- Loop closures: Should increase periodically
- Memory usage: Should stay < 500MB
- CPU usage: Should stay < 60%

## Issue Response Procedures

### If SLAM Confidence Drops
1. Check feature count: `ros2 topic echo /slam/system/health`
2. If features < 50: Increase `Kp/MaxFeatures` or improve lighting
3. Verify camera isn't blocked: `ros2 topic echo /camera/rgb/image_raw`
4. Check depth data: `ros2 topic echo /slam/depth/processed`

### If Memory Usage Exceeds 600MB
1. Check current map size: `ros2 run rtabmap_ros rtabmap --info`
2. Reduce `Mem/MaxMemoryMB` to 300
3. Monitor if memory drops
4. If not, restart: `ros2 daemon stop; ros2 daemon start`

### If GPS and SLAM Diverge
1. Check GPS status: `ros2 topic echo /gps/fix`
2. If GPS has no fix: Switch to SLAM-only (will continue)
3. If GPS ok: May be calibration issue
4. Reduce `slam_confidence_threshold` to favor GPS more

### If System Becomes Unresponsive
1. Check CPU: `top` (if > 80%, reduce features)
2. Check memory: `free -h` (if < 200MB free, restart)
3. Emergency recovery: Press Ctrl+C, then `ros2 daemon kill`

## Post-Mission Analysis

```bash
# Check final statistics
ros2 run rtabmap_ros rtabmap --info

# Review system health log
grep "SLAM System" ~/.ros/log/* | tail -20

# Validate map quality
# (Map will be in ~/.rtabmap/rtabmap.db)

# Check for any errors
grep "ERROR" ~/.ros/log/* | head -20
```

## Troubleshooting Guide Reference

| Symptom | Check | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No features detected | `/camera/rgb/image_raw` quality | Improve lighting, increase `Kp/MaxFeatures` |
| High confidence but wrong pose | Camera calibration | Recalibrate camera |
| GPS pulls pose away from true path | GPS accuracy setting | Increase `gps_std_dev` value |
| System freezes | Memory/CPU usage | Reduce features or memory limit |
| Loop closures never detected | Environment is too sparse | Decrease `Mem/RehearsalSimilarity` |
| Jerky/delayed pose updates | Update latency | Reduce feature count or image resolution |

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Stop
```bash
# Hard stop all nodes
killall -9 rtabmap depth_processor gps_fusion

# Or via ROS 2
ros2 daemon kill
ros2 daemon start
```

### Recovery from Crash
```bash
# If SLAM crashes during mission:
ros2 topic echo /slam/pose/fused
# Will switch to /slam/pose (SLAM only)
# If both fail, will use /gps/fix (GPS only)

# Restart full system:
ros2 launch autonomy_slam slam_rtabmap.launch.py
```

### Database Corruption
```bash
# If RTAB-Map database corrupted:
rm ~/.rtabmap/rtabmap.db
ros2 launch autonomy_slam slam_rtabmap.launch.py
# System will start fresh map
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] Log system performance metrics
- [ ] Review memory/CPU usage patterns
- [ ] Validate pose accuracy against ground truth
- [ ] Analyze loop closure detection performance
- [ ] Update parameter tuning guide if needed
- [ ] Document any environmental adjustments
- [ ] Archive system logs and maps
- [ ] Plan next iteration improvements
