## 🏆 **Competition Justification (URC 2026 Mission Mapping)**

### **State Hierarchy Design Rationale**

The state machine directly maps to URC 2026 competition requirements:

```
SystemState Hierarchy (7 top-level states)
├── BOOT           → System initialization (required for all missions)
├── CALIBRATION    → Sensor calibration (required before autonomous ops)
├── IDLE           → Ready state (competition standby)
├── TELEOPERATION  → Manual control (allowed during missions)
├── AUTONOMOUS     → Competition mission execution
│   ├── SCIENCE           → Mission 1.b (science sample collection)
│   ├── DELIVERY          → Mission 1.d (object pickup/delivery)
│   ├── EQUIPMENT_SERVICING → Mission 1.e (lander operations)
│   └── AUTONOMOUS_NAVIGATION → Mission 1.f (target navigation)
├── SAFETY         → Emergency handling (competition safety requirements)
└── SHUTDOWN       → Graceful termination (end of missions)
```

### **Mission-Specific State Justifications**

#### **🏆 Mission 1.f: Autonomous Navigation (AUTONOMOUS_NAVIGATION)**
```
JUSTIFICATION: Direct competition requirement mapping
- Required: Navigate to 7 targets within 30 minutes
- State enables: GNSS + ArUco marker navigation
- LED signaling: Red (autonomous), Blue (teleop), Flashing Green (success)
- Validation: Prevents manual intervention penalties
```

#### **🔧 Mission 1.e: Equipment Servicing (EQUIPMENT_SERVICING)**
```
JUSTIFICATION: Complex dexterous operations require state management
EquipmentServicingSubstate progression:
├── TRAVELING          → Navigate to lander (100m, 30min time limit)
├── SAMPLE_DELIVERY    → Insert sample tubes, seal cache
├── PANEL_OPERATIONS   → Open drawers, access panels
├── AUTONOMOUS_TYPING  → Input 3-6 letter launch codes (ArUco markers)
├── USB_CONNECTION     → Connect USB, read data (1x1cm ArUco)
├── FUEL_CONNECTION    → Connect GatorLock hose fitting
├── BUTTON_OPERATIONS  → Push buttons, flip switches, turn knobs
└── COMPLETE          → Mission completion verification
```

#### **📦 Mission 1.d: Delivery Mission (DELIVERY)**
```
JUSTIFICATION: Object handling requires autonomous coordination
- Required: Pick up and deliver objects up to 5kg
- State enables: Manipulation + Navigation coordination
- GNSS coordinates provided for all pickup/delivery locations
- Optional drone support integration
```

#### **🔬 Mission 1.b: Science Mission (SCIENCE)**
```
JUSTIFICATION: Sample collection and analysis workflow
- Required: Subsurface sampling (≥10cm depth, ≥5g mass)
- State enables: Science instruments + documentation coordination
- Site documentation: panoramas, close-ups, stratigraphic profiles
- Onboard analysis: life detection + secondary science capability
```

#### **🎮 TELEOPERATION State Justification**
```
JUSTIFICATION: Competition allows manual intervention
- Allowed: Operator takeover during missions
- Required: LED signaling (Blue = teleoperation)
- Benefit: Reduces penalties vs. complete autonomous failure
- Safety: Maintains human oversight capability
```

#### **🚨 SAFETY State Justification**
```
JUSTIFICATION: Competition safety and emergency requirements
- Required: Physical E-stop button (red push-button)
- Competition rule: "Emergency stop must be red push-button"
- Enables: Safe recovery from autonomous failures
- Prevents: Runaway robot scenarios during testing
```

### **State Transition Rules (Competition Compliance)**

```python
# BOOT → CALIBRATION/IDLE (required sequence)
# Prevents: Skipping calibration (safety risk)
# Enables: Proper sensor initialization

# IDLE → AUTONOMOUS (only after calibration)
# Prevents: Uncalibrated autonomous operation
# Enables: Accurate navigation and perception

# AUTONOMOUS → SAFETY (emergency handling)
# Required: Immediate halt capability
# Enables: Competition safety compliance

# SAFETY → IDLE (only after recovery)
# Prevents: Returning to autonomous without verification
# Enables: Safe resumption of operations
```

## 📚 **Enhanced Self-Documentation**

### **Code Documentation Improvements**

```python
# BEFORE: Basic state definition
class SystemState(Enum):
    BOOT = "BOOT"  # Initial startup
    CALIBRATION = "CALIBRATION"  # Sensor calibration

# AFTER: Competition-justified state definition
class SystemState(Enum):
    """
    Top-level system states for URC 2026 competition compliance.

    Each state maps to specific competition requirements:
    - BOOT: System initialization (required for all missions)
    - CALIBRATION: Sensor calibration before autonomous ops (safety requirement)
    - IDLE: Competition standby state (ready for mission assignment)
    - TELEOPERATION: Manual control (allowed during missions, LED=Blue)
    - AUTONOMOUS: Competition mission execution (LED=Red, various substates)
    - SAFETY: Emergency handling (physical E-stop required, LED=Flashing)
    - SHUTDOWN: Graceful termination (mission completion)
    """

    BOOT = "BOOT"  # System initialization and startup sequence
    CALIBRATION = "CALIBRATION"  # Sensor calibration (required before autonomous)
    IDLE = "IDLE"  # Ready state awaiting mission commands
    TELEOPERATION = "TELEOPERATION"  # Manual remote control (competition allowed)
    AUTONOMOUS = "AUTONOMOUS"  # Autonomous mission execution (core competition requirement)
    SAFETY = "SAFETY"  # Emergency/safety state (E-stop compliance)
    SHUTDOWN = "SHUTDOWN"  # Graceful system shutdown
```

### **Function Documentation Enhancement**

```python
def _execute_transition(self, to_state: SystemState, ...) -> bool:
    """
    Execute state transition with competition compliance validation.

    Competition Requirements Validated:
    - Mission time limits (BOOT timeout: 30s, autonomous missions: 30-60min)
    - Safety constraints (no autonomous without calibration)
    - LED signaling requirements (red=blue=green state indication)
    - Emergency stop handling (immediate SAFETY transition)

    Args:
        to_state: Target state (must be competition-compliant transition)
        to_substate: Mission-specific substate for AUTONOMOUS
        reason: Competition-relevant transition justification
        initiated_by: Operator/system initiating transition

    Returns:
        bool: True if transition completed successfully

    Raises:
        StateTransitionError: If transition violates competition rules
    """
```
