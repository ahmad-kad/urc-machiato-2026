## ROS 2 Package Setup

#### **🎯 Context & Purpose**
**Why This Task Exists**: State Management serves as the central nervous system for the entire rover, coordinating all 6 subsystems. Without a proper ROS 2 package structure, the state management system cannot monitor, control, or coordinate the rover's autonomous operations. This task establishes the foundational infrastructure that enables mission control and system orchestration.

**What This Enables**: Centralized command and control, inter-subsystem communication, mission coordination, and health monitoring across all rover systems. This creates the "brain" that makes autonomous operation possible.
